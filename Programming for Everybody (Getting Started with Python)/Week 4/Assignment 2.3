2.3  Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. 
Use 35 hours and a rate of 2.75 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 96.25).
You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking or bad user data.


hrs = float(input("Enter Hours:"))
rate = float(input("Enter rate:"))
pay = hrs * rate
print("Pay:",pay)
