9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has sent the greatest number of mail messages.The program looks
for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. The program creates a Python dictionary that maps
the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through
the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.


name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)
lst = list()
for lines in handle:
	words = lines.split()
    	if lines.startswith("From "):
    	#for word in words:
       		lst.append(words[1])
        
dic = dict()
for word in lst:
    dic[word] = dic.get(word,0) + 1
    
bigw = None
bigc = None
for word,count in dic.items():
    if bigc is None or count > bigc:
        bigw = word
        bigc = count
        
print(bigw,bigc)
