10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages.
You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.
From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008 Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.


name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)

hcount = dict()                                     #create empty dictionary
hlst = []                                           #create empty list

for line in handle: 
    words = line.split()
    if len(words) > 2 and words[0] == 'From':       #Select lines with 'From'
        hr = words[5].split(':')                    #Select hour (5th index) and split string with colon
        hcount[hr[0]] = hcount.get(hr[0], 0) + 1    #increase count for each hour
    else:
        continue

for k,v in hcount.items():                           #k = hour, v = count
    hlst.append((k,v))                               #append tuples to list

hlst.sort()                                         #sort list by hour
for k,v in hlst:                                    #loop through list of tuples
    print (k,v)          


Desired Output : 04 3
                 06 1
                 07 1
                 09 2
                 10 3
                 11 6
                 14 1
                 15 2
                 16 4
                 17 2
                 18 1
                 19 1
